# Fed-ViT-AutoRL Architecture

## System Overview

Fed-ViT-AutoRL implements a federated reinforcement learning framework where autonomous vehicles collaboratively train Vision Transformer models for perception while preserving privacy and meeting real-time constraints.

## Core Components

### 1. Vision Transformer Backbone
- **Purpose**: Extract visual features from camera/LiDAR data
- **Implementation**: Transformer architecture with learnable positional embeddings
- **Optimization**: Pruning, quantization for edge deployment

### 2. Federated Learning Framework
- **Aggregation**: FedAvg, FedProx, and custom algorithms
- **Privacy**: Differential privacy, secure aggregation
- **Communication**: Gradient compression, asynchronous updates

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Algorithms**: PPO, SAC adapted for federated setting
- **Policy**: Vision-based driving policy
- **Reward**: Safety, comfort, efficiency metrics

### 4. Edge Deployment
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson, Intel Movidius, custom ASICs
- **Optimization**: TensorRT, ONNX Runtime
- **Real-time**: <100ms inference latency

## Data Flow

```
Camera/LiDAR → ViT Perception → Detection/Segmentation → RL Policy → Control
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓          ↓
Local Storage → Experience Buffer → Gradient Computation → Federated Agg → Global Model
```

## Privacy Architecture

### Local Differential Privacy
- Noise injection at vehicle level
- Configurable epsilon/delta parameters
- Trade-off between privacy and utility

### Secure Aggregation
- Cryptographic protocols prevent model inversion
- Threshold-based decryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification

## Scalability Considerations

### Hierarchical Federation
- Regional aggregation servers
- Global coordination layer
- Reduces communication overhead

### Asynchronous Updates
- Handle vehicles with different connectivity
- Staleness-aware aggregation
- Fault tolerance mechanisms

## Performance Characteristics

### Inference Latency
- Target: <100ms end-to-end
- ViT: ~50ms on Jetson Xavier NX
- Detection/Segmentation: ~30ms
- RL Policy: ~20ms

### Communication Overhead
- Gradient compression: 100x reduction
- Asynchronous updates: 50% less traffic
- Secure aggregation: 10% overhead

### Memory Footprint
- Full model: ~300MB
- Pruned model: ~75MB
- Quantized model: ~19MB

## Safety and Reliability

### Fail-safe Mechanisms
- Fallback to conservative driving policy
- Model validation before deployment
- Runtime anomaly detection

### Testing Framework
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Hardware-in-the-loop validation
