# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status

## Context
We need a standardized format for documenting architectural decisions to maintain decision history and rationale for future reference.

## Decision
Use the MADR (Markdown Architecture Decision Records) format for all architectural decisions.

## Consequences
- Provides consistent documentation format
- Enables future developers to understand design rationale
- Creates searchable decision history
- Establishes accountability for architectural choices

## Template Structure
```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Context
[Description of the problem and why a decision is needed]

## Decision

```

## Usage
1. Copy this template for new ADRs
2. Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
3. Use descriptive titles
4. Update status as decisions evolve
5. Link related ADRs when appropriate
