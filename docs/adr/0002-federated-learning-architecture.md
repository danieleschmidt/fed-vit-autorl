# ADR-0002: Federated Learning Architecture for Autonomous Vehicles

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Autonomous vehicles need to continuously improve their perception models while preserving privacy and handling heterogeneous hardware capabilities. Traditional centralized learning approaches face challenges:
- Privacy concerns with sharing raw sensor data
- Bandwidth limitations for large datasets
- Diverse hardware capabilities across vehicle fleet
- Real-time performance requirements

## Decision
Implement a hierarchical federated learning architecture with:
1. **Local Training**: Each vehicle trains locally on private data
2. **Regional Aggregation**: Regional servers aggregate models from nearby vehicles
3. **Global Coordination**: Central server coordinates global model updates
4. **Privacy Preservation**: Differential privacy and secure aggregation
5. **Edge Optimization**: Model pruning and quantization for real-time inference

## Consequences

### Positive
- Preserves data privacy through local training
- Reduces communication overhead via hierarchical structure
- Enables personalized models for different driving conditions
- Scales to large vehicle fleets
- Maintains real-time performance requirements

### Negative
- Increased system complexity
- Potential for model staleness in async scenarios
- Communication overhead for model updates
- Requires sophisticated privacy mechanisms
- Challenging debugging and monitoring

### Neutral
- Requires standardized model architectures across fleet
- Need for robust failure handling mechanisms
- Dependency on secure communication protocols
