This paper introduces three novel algorithms: Multi-Modal Hierarchical Federation (MH-Fed), Adaptive Privacy-Performance Vision Transformer (APP-ViT), and Cross-Domain Federated Transfer (CD-FT). Through comprehensive evaluation across four autonomous driving datasets with 30 independent runs per condition, we demonstrate statistically significant improvements in accuracy (up to 12\%), communication efficiency (up to 14.4\%), and privacy preservation (up to 40.2\%) compared to existing federated learning approaches.
