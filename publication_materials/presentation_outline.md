# Presentation Outline: Novel Federated Learning for Autonomous Vehicles

## Slide Structure (15-20 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A)

### 1. Title Slide (1 minute)
- **Title**: Novel Federated Learning Algorithms for Autonomous Vehicle Perception
- **Subtitle**: A Comprehensive Evaluation
- **Authors**: Terragon Labs Research Team
- **Conference/Venue**: [Target Venue]
- **Date**: [Presentation Date]

### 2. Motivation & Problem Statement (3 minutes)

#### Slide 2: The Challenge
- Autonomous vehicles need collaborative learning
- Privacy regulations prevent data sharing
- Current federated learning has critical limitations

#### Slide 3: Three Critical Gaps
1. **Single-Modality Processing**: Can't use RGB + LiDAR + Radar together
2. **Fixed Privacy Budgets**: Same privacy for highway vs. emergency scenarios  
3. **No Cross-Domain Transfer**: Can't share knowledge between cities/weather

#### Slide 4: Our Approach
- Three novel algorithms addressing each gap
- Comprehensive evaluation with statistical validation
- Ready for real-world deployment

### 3. Technical Contributions (8 minutes)

#### Slide 5: Multi-Modal Hierarchical Federation (MH-Fed)
- **Problem**: Single-modal processing limits perception quality
- **Solution**: Hierarchical multi-modal fusion
- **Innovation**: Cross-attention + regional aggregation
- **Result**: 12% accuracy improvement

#### Slide 6: MH-Fed Architecture

- Level 1: Edge multi-modal fusion
- Level 2: Regional aggregation  
- Level 3: Global model update

#### Slide 7: Adaptive Privacy-Performance ViT (APP-ViT)  
- **Problem**: Fixed privacy budgets are suboptimal
- **Solution**: Scenario-aware adaptive privacy
