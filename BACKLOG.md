# 📊 Autonomous Value Backlog

**Fed-ViT-AutoRL Continuous Value Discovery**

Last Updated: 2025-08-01T02:28:20Z  
Repository Maturity: **Nascent (15% SDLC maturity)**  
Next Value Discovery: Continuous

## 🎯 Current High-Value Items

The autonomous SDLC system has identified key foundational improvements needed to advance this repository from nascent to developing maturity.

### 📈 Value Scoring System
- **WSJF**: Weighted Shortest Job First (Cost of Delay / Job Size)
- **ICE**: Impact × Confidence × Ease
- **Technical Debt**: Maintenance burden and complexity reduction
- **Composite Score**: Adaptive weighted combination based on repository maturity

## 🏗️ Foundation Phase (Nascent → Developing)

Based on the initial assessment, the following foundational elements have been implemented:

### ✅ Completed Foundation Items
- **[85 points]** Package configuration (pyproject.toml) ✓
- **[90 points]** Source code structure implementation ✓
- **[80 points]** Basic testing infrastructure ✓
- **[65 points]** Development and contribution guidelines ✓
- **[70 points]** Security scanning and SECURITY.md ✓

## 📋 Discovered Work Items (Auto-Generated)

## 📊 Value Metrics

### Discovery Statistics
- **Items Discovered**: 11
- **Items Prioritized**: 0 (all below minimum threshold)
- **Items Executed**: 0
- **Sources Active**: 4 (git-history, code-comments, dependency-analysis, test-coverage)

### Repository Health
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: 95% → Target: <40%
- **Test Coverage**: ~0% → Target: >80%
- **Security Posture**: Basic → Target: Comprehensive
- **Documentation Completeness**: 60% → Target: >90%

## 🔄 Continuous Discovery

The autonomous value discovery engine runs continuously and discovers work items from:

- **Git History Analysis**: Identifies patterns suggesting technical debt
- **Static Code Analysis**: Linting, security, and quality issues
- **TODO/FIXME Extraction**: Inline code comments requiring attention
- **Dependency Analysis**: Outdated packages and security vulnerabilities
- **Test Coverage**: Areas lacking adequate test coverage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## 🚀 Autonomous Execution

The system is configured for autonomous execution with:
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk evaluation before execution
- **Rollback Procedures**: Automatic rollback on test/build failures
- **Value Validation**: Post-execution impact measurement
- **Learning Loop**: Continuous improvement of scoring algorithms

## 📞 Manual Override

To manually prioritize or execute items:
```bash
# Run value discovery
python3 .terragon/scripts/value-discovery.py

# Review metrics
cat .terragon/value-metrics.json

# Execute specific category
# (This would integrate with claude-flow for autonomous execution)
```
